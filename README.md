# RNAVaccineDesignDataSourceIntegration
An end-to-end data ingestion and integration pipeline for RNA vaccine discovery. This repo fetches, cleans, normalizes, and links biological and immunological research paper data from public sources (like NCBI, UniProt, PDB, and IEDB) to support downstream machine learning models and rational mRNA vaccine design workflows.
